Upload your solution as zip archive until Saturday 13th January 23:59 into the public Homework Submissions folder on studip. The archive should contain your solution as iPython notebook (.ipynb) and as HTML export. Name the archive ﬁle as <your group id > policy-gradients.zip.\n",

    "# 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week’s task, we are going to implement a network that learns to balance a pole on a cart. The network will learn how to map an observation to an appropriate action.\n",
    "# 2 Data, OpenAI Gym\n",
    "Install the OpenAI Gym pip package (pip instsall gym). Create a CartPolev0 environment and create a loop that can retrieve an observation and selects and executes a random action, until the episode is done. Create a loop around that loop, such that you can run the environment for several episodes. Render the environment every N episodes and keep in mind, that rendering does slow down the learning drastically, since if the process is not visualized, it does not restrict the frame rate and runs as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation \n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation is a four-dimensional array: [cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole velocity at tip].\n",
    "\n",
    "Action \n",
    "\n",
    "space At each time-step, the agent has to decide to either push the cart to the left or the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reward \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent receives a +1 reward for each time-step until the episode terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Episode Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "The episode terminates, if either the pole angle is more than +/- 12 degree, the cart moved out of the display or if the episode length is greater than 200. Hence, the maximum reward that can be reached is 200."
